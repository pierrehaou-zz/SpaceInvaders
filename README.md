# Ultimate Space Invaders
This project was inspired by the classic “Space Invaders” game. Using the Pygame library, this project was developed in Python.  Making for a more interesting player experience, I designed two enemy types, one of which was implemented using a simple pathfinder algorithm. There are six levels to this game, and as the player progresses in score, the level increases accordingly. 
# How to play
To play the game, double click the .exe file. If you have both the correct version of python and pygame, you can play this game by running main2.py in the command terminal. It should resemble the following:

```
cd SpaceInvaders
python main2.py
```
Note: This was developed in Python 3
